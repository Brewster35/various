# Basic parser in C#
This project is the beginnings of a basic parser in C# that generates an abstract syntax tree. It is based on the javascript example in this video series: [Building a Parser from scratch. Lecture [1/18]: Tokenizer | Parser - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4m7ubrdbWQU)

One day I might finish it!
